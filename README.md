# grouping
Example algorithm that groups entities from a list.

Imagine you have a list of data records. For example trips from truck drivers. Every trip has certain attributes like
ID, driver name, truck id, location and time of departure, etc.

Now you want to group those data records by certain attributes like all trips with the same driver and truck in a 
single group.

This project shows you how to do this. It uses Java 8 and Maven.
